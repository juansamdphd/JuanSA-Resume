	abstract = {The Pannexin 1 (Panx1) ion and metabolite channel is expressed in a wide variety of cells where it regulates a number of cell behaviours including proliferation and differentiation. Panx1 is expressed on the cell surface as well as intracellular membranes. Previous work suggests that a region within the proximal Panx1 C-terminus (Panx1CT) regulates cell surface localization. Here we report the discovery of a putative leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motif in the proximal Panx1CT necessary for Panx1 cell surface expression in {HEK}293T cells. Deletion of the putative {LRR} motif results in significant loss of Panx1 cell surface distribution. Outcomes of complementary cell surface oligomerization and glycosylation state analyses were consistent with reduced cell surface expression of Panx1 {LRR} deletion mutants. Of note, the oligomerization analysis revealed the presence of putative dimers and trimers of Panx1 at the cell surface. Expression of Panx1 increased {HEK}293T cell growth and reduced doubling time, while expression of a Panx1 {LRR} deletion mutant (highly conserved segment) did not reproduce this effect. In summary, here we discovered the presence of a putative {LRR} motif in the Panx1CT that impacts on Panx1 cell surface localization. Overall these findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying C-terminal regulation of Panx1 trafficking and raise potential new lines of investigation with respect to Panx1 oligomerization and glycosylation.},

	abstract = {Ankyrin B ({AnkB}) is an adaptor and scaffold for motor proteins and various ion channels that is ubiquitously expressed, including in the brain. {AnkB} has been associated with neurological disorders such as epilepsy and autism spectrum disorder, but understanding of the underlying mechanisms is limited. Cav2.1, the pore-forming subunit of P/Q type voltage gated calcium channels, is a known interactor of {AnkB} and plays a crucial role in neuronal function. Here we report that wildtype {AnkB} increased overall Cav2.1 levels without impacting surface Cav2.1 levels in {HEK}293T cells. An {AnkB} variant, p.S646F, which we recently discovered to be associated with seizures, further increased overall Cav2.1 levels, again with no impact on surface Cav2.1 levels. {AnkB} p.Q879R, on the other hand, increased surface Cav2.1 levels in the presence of accessory subunits α2δ1 and β4. Additionally, {AnkB} p.E1458G decreased surface Cav2.1 irrespective of the presence of accessory subunits. In addition, we found that partial deletion of {AnkB} in cortex resulted in a decrease in overall Cav2.1 levels, with no change to the levels of Cav2.1 detected in synaptosome fractions. Our work suggests that depending on the particular variant, {AnkB} regulates intracellular and surface Cav2.1. Notably, expression of the {AnkB} variant associated with seizure ({AnkB} p.S646F) caused further increase in intracellular Cav2.1 levels above that of even wildtype {AnkB}. These novel findings have important implications for understanding the role of {AnkB} and Cav2.1 in the regulation of neuronal function in health and disease.},

	abstract = {Neurite formation relies on finely-tuned control of the cytoskeleton. Here we identified a novel protein-protein interaction between the ion and metabolite channel protein Panx1 and collapsin response mediator protein 2 (Crmp2), a positive regulator of microtubule polymerization and stabilization. Panx1 and Crmp2 co-precipitated from both Neuro-2a (N2a) cells and mouse ventricular zone tissue. In vitro binding assays between purified proteins revealed the interaction occurs directly between the Panx1 C-terminus and Crmp2. Because Crmp2 is a well-established microtubule-stabilizing protein, and we previously observed a marked increase in neurite formation following treatment with the Panx1 blocker, probenecid, in N2a cells and ventricular zone neural precursor cells, we investigated the impact of probenecid on the Panx1-Crmp2 interaction. Probenecid treatment significantly disrupted the Panx1-Crmp2 interaction by both immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation analysis, without altering overall Crmp2 protein expression levels. In the presence of probenecid, Crmp2 was concentrated at the distal ends of growing neurites. Moreover, probenecid treatment increased tubulin polymerization and microtubule stability in N2a cells. These results reveal that probenecid disrupts a novel interaction between Panx1 and the microtubule stabilizer, Crmp2, and also increases microtubule stability.},

	abstract = {Purpose After cortical stroke, neural precursor cells ({NPCs}) in the distal ventricular zone ({VZ}) proliferate more rapidly and migrate toward the injured cortex. While evidence suggests this can enhance stroke recovery, the underlying molecular mechanisms initiating the response are poorly understood. Here we identified changes in protein expression in the ipsilateral {VZ} early (4 h) after stroke to gain insight into the initial mechanisms involved in {NPC} activation post-stroke. Experimental design Four hours after photothrombotic stroke (or sham surgery control) in the sensorimotor cortex, adult mice (10 stroke, 10 sham) were subjected to cardiac perfusion with {PBS}, and ipsilateral and contralateral {VZ} tissue was microdissected. Two separate sets of ipsilateral and contralateral {VZ} tissues (from 5 pooled surgery or 5 pooled sham mice) were analyzed simultaneously using 8-plex {iTRAQ}. We used Western blotting and confocal microscopy to confirm changes in protein expression in the {VZ} ipsilateral to stroke in a separate cohort of mice. Results We identified nine proteins which exhibited a significant mean increase (by ≥ 2-fold) in stroke ipsilateral compared to sham ipsilateral. Many of these proteins were antiproteases or cytokine/growth factor binding proteins that are known to act as inflammatory responders or effectors and play roles in modulating tissue growth and remodeling. Conclusion and clinical relevance These novel findings support a growing body of literature that inflammatory signaling is involved in the {NPC} response to brain injury and identifies novel potential targets that could be exploited to better understand and to optimize this regenerative response.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The Pannexin 1 (Panx1) channel-forming protein is enriched in the central nervous system, and has been associated with several critical neurodevelopmental and plasticity functions; these include dendritic spine formation, neuronal network development, synaptic plasticity, and pathological brain states such as ischemia, epilepsy, and neurodegeneration. Despite major advances in understanding the properties and activation modes of Panx1, the Panx1 interactome remains largely uncharacterized. Considering that Panx1 has been implicated in critical neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative processes and diseases, we investigated the Panx1 interactome (482 Panx1-interacting proteins) identified from mouse N2a cells. These proteins were cross-analyzed with the postsynaptic proteome of the adult mouse brain previously identified by mass spectrometry ({LC}-{MS}/{MS}), and neurodegenerative disease and neurodevelopmental disorder susceptibility genes previously identified by genome-wide association studies ({GWAS}); and then further investigated using various bioinformatics tools ({PANTHER}, {GO}, {KEGG} and {STRING} databases). A total of 104 of the Panx1-interacting proteins were located at the postsynapse, and 99 of these formed a 16-cluster protein-protein interaction ({PPI}) network (hub proteins: Eef2, Rab6A, Ddx39b, Mapk1, Fh1, Ndufv1 et cetera). The cross-analysis led to the discovery of proteins and candidate genes involved in synaptic function and homeostasis. Of particular note, our analyses also revealed that certain Panx1-interacting proteins are implicated in Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, Huntington disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder and epilepsy. Altogether, our work revealed important clues to the role of Panx1 in neuronal function in health and disease by expanding our knowledge of the {PPI} network of Panx1, and unveiling previously unidentified Panx1-interacting proteins and networks involved in biological processes and disease.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Ankyrin-B ({AnkB}) is scaffolding protein that anchors integral membrane proteins to the 
 cardiomyocyte cytoskeleton. We recently identified an {AnkB} variant, {AnkB} p.S646F ({ANK}2  c.1937 C{\textgreater}T) associated with a phenotype ranging from predisposition for cardiac arrhythmia to cardiomyopathy. {AnkB} p.S646F exhibited reduced expression levels in the H9c2 rat ventricular- derived cardiomyoblast cell line relative to wildtype {AnkB}. Here we demonstrate that {AnkB} is regulated by proteasomal degradation and proteasome inhibition rescues {AnkB} p.S646F expression levels in H9c2 cells, although this effect is not conserved with differentiation. We also compared the impact of wildtype {AnkB} and {AnkB} p.S646F on cell viability and proliferation. {AnkB} p.S646F expression resulted in decreased cell viability at 30 hours post-transfection, whereas we observed a greater proportion of cycling, Ki67-positive cells at 48 h post-transfection. Notably, the number of {GFP}-positive cells was low, and was consistent between wildtype {AnkB} and {AnkB} p.S646F expressing cells, suggesting that {AnkB} and {AnkB} p.S646F affected paracrine communication between H9c2 cells differentially. In summary, this work reveals {AnkB} levels are regulated by the proteasome, and that {AnkB} p.S646F compromises cell viability.
